# BL-Browser-Installer

[BL-Browser](https://github.com/Pah1023/BL-Browser) is an implementation of Awesomium for Blockland that allows you to load webpages/videos in-game.

This is an installer that will attempt to install BL-Browser for a user automatically, while ensuring the user has all the dependencies required to run it and is running a compatible operating system.

# Compiling

The following stuff is required to compile the source yourself:

- NSIS v3.02.1: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download
- BL-Browser v0.2.1: https://github.com/Pah1023/BL-Browser/releases/tag/v0.2.1

Place the contents of BL-Browser into `instfiles` then use NSIS to run `main.nsi`.
